# Node.JS Youtube and Facebook video content collection
It was designed to provide a reliable server-to-server automation solution, with additional support for transparent Google API OAuth2 token negotiation retrieval using [Nightmare](http://nightmarejs.org) + [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) in case that you don't have a valid OAuth2 token or simply you want to use a fresh token every time automatically

**Rationale note**: I created this package to solve my personal frustration after using further solutions to interact with Youtube Videos API in a realiable way. I wish it can dissipate your frustration as well.
